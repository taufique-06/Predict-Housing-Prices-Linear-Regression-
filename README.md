# Predict-Housing-Prices-Linear-Regression

###
Here I have tried to build a ML model that
1. Learn pattern in California Housing data
2. Then uses that to predict house prices

In a simple term, we will be teaching a computer that "if a house is in this area, and people earn this much, and it's this old, how much would it cost?
